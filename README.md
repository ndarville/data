How to Convert an Excel Spreadsheet to CSV
------------------------------------------
There are three recurring problems, when I try to convert an Excel spreadsheet to CSV:

1. Unicode characters are garbled.
2. The comma-separated file is ... semicolon-separated.
3. Cell entries containing separator characters are not wrapped in quotes.
4. Wrong decimal separators.

Work in progress ...
